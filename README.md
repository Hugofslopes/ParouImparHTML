## Summary
<p> This project was made for the module of “” from the Java IEFP course. It could be anything we wanted or a theme that we had already used before. Since I created this game in two other modules before, first in “” and then in “___”, I wanted to improve the game a little more and add some graphics to it. For this game, I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS."
